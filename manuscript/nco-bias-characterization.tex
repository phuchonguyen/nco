\begin{abstract}%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of .sty file
\todo{}Psychohistory combines history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people. There are two axioms of psychohistory: (1) the population whose behaviour is modeled should be sufficiently large; (2) the population should remain in ignorance of the results of the application of psychohistorical analyses.  In this paper, we use psychohistory to predict the results of large observational studies.
