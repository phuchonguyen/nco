    "At enrolment, women underwent a standardized history and clinical exam and had blood collected by venipuncture for baseline laboratory testing, filter paper sample and storage for future use. Baseline laboratory testing consisted of a thick blood smear for malaria parasites (which was read later by laboratory technicians not involved in study participants care and was not used for clinical care), qPCR for malaria parasites, CBC (hemoglobin, white blood cell count neutrophil count, platelet count) and ALT. After enrolment, pregnant women were reviewed routinely every 4 weeks for study drug administration and all clinical and laboratory data was recorded onto standardized case record forms (CRFs) by study clinicians. Information collected every 4 weeks during pregnancy included clinical data from history and clinical exam and results from laboratory tests which included blood smears for determination of malaria parasites, and qPCR for malaria parasite. Routine CBC and ALT were done at 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation. At any visit (scheduled or unscheduled), pregnant women who presented with a history of fever in the past 24 hours or a temperature > 38.0ºC (tympanic) had an urgent thick blood smear read in the study clinic. Women with a positive urgent thick blood smear were diagnosed with malaria and treated according to Uganda ministry of health guidelines.\n",
